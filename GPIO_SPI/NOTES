    # SLAVE MODE
When SS is held low, the SPI is activated, and MISO becomes an output if configured so by the user. All
other pins are inputs.
 When SS is driven high, all pins are inputs except MISO which can be user
configured as an output, and the SPI is passive, which means that it will not receive incoming
data.
